# Build.Myweb_Project_1

I have been part of a course known as build.myweb. The course teaches students how to use HTML, CSS and Bootstrap to create their own websites. While I did start doing the course, I stopped half way due to internal examinations and other commitments. Now I am picking up where I left off to hopefully complete what I started.
